Backend API for Movies Website v2

Movie
 - Movie contains information such as Title, ID, Release Date, Genres, and more

Genre
 - HORROR, ADVENTURE, ACTION, etc.

GetMovieRequest (/movies/)
 - Request for movie, can take in MovieID, Release Year, Genre, and a Title
 - Will use this to create a Database query and will return a GetMovieResult with list of movies found
GetMovieResult
 - List of Movies found from request received

 Movies received from GetMovieResult will then be displayed on FrontEnd as return will be JSONArray of Movie objects in JSON

 Things to keep in mind:
 * GetMovieRequest should handle making calls to look for movies in external APIs in case new releases have been made
 regardless of whether movie appears or not
 * Should also update movie list with latest movies
 * Also update existing movie info if it is incomplete due to not being able to receive all the info
 * Should have a minimum threshold of missing info as in old website, random movies would appear occasionally
 * Ways to do this would be by using APIs or WebScraping for new releases

 Should be much more organized and easier to read/build upon than old website

 Separation of Back-End and Front-End already makes requests much easier to execute and Java makes managing movie
 data much nicer
